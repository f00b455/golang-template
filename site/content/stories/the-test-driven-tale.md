# The Test-Driven Tale

Once upon a time in a development team far, far away, there was a developer named Alex who didn't believe in writing tests first.

## The Skeptic

"Why would I write tests for code that doesn't exist?" Alex would argue. "It's like drawing a map before exploring the territory!"

The team's senior developer, Emma, just smiled. "Let me tell you a story," she said.

## The Challenge

Emma proposed a challenge: "Let's both implement a simple calculator. You write code first, I'll write tests first. We'll see who finishes with fewer bugs."

Alex accepted eagerly, confident in their coding abilities.

## Alex's Approach

Alex dove straight into coding:

```go
type Calculator struct {
    result float64
}

func (c *Calculator) Add(a, b float64) float64 {
    c.result = a + b
    return c.result
}

func (c *Calculator) Divide(a, b float64) float64 {
    c.result = a / b
    return c.result
}
```

"Done!" Alex announced after 10 minutes.

## Emma's Journey

Emma started differently:

```go
func TestCalculatorAdd(t *testing.T) {
    calc := NewCalculator()
    result := calc.Add(2, 3)
    assert.Equal(t, 5.0, result)
}

func TestCalculatorDivideByZero(t *testing.T) {
    calc := NewCalculator()
    result := calc.Divide(10, 0)
    assert.True(t, math.IsInf(result, 1))
}
```

Only after writing tests did Emma implement the calculator.

## The Revelation

When they tested Alex's calculator:
- Division by zero caused a panic
- Negative numbers weren't handled correctly in some edge cases
- The state management with `result` field caused unexpected behaviors

Emma's calculator, guided by tests written first:
- Handled all edge cases
- Had clear, documented behavior
- Was already verified to work correctly

## The Lesson

Alex learned that test-driven development wasn't about testing—it was about design. Writing tests first forced you to think about:

1. **Interface Design**: How will others use this code?
2. **Edge Cases**: What could go wrong?
3. **Dependencies**: What does this code need?
4. **Success Criteria**: When is it "done"?

## The Convert

From that day forward, Alex became a TDD advocate. The rhythm became natural:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests green

## The Happy Ending

The team's bug count dropped by 70%. Refactoring became fearless. New features were added with confidence.

And Alex? They became known for delivering the most reliable code on the team.

"Tests aren't extra work," Alex would tell new developers. "They're your safety net, your documentation, and your design tool all in one."

## The Moral

Write tests first, and the code will follow. Write code first, and bugs will follow.

*Remember: TDD isn't slower—it just puts the thinking where it belongs: at the beginning.*
