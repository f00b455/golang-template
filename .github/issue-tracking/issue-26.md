## Description
## User Story
**As a** developer  
**I want** minimal Hugo integration with bare-bones functionality and story content  
**So that** I can have a clean static site generator foundation without fancy styling  

## Background/Context

- [ ] Plain HTML templates (no CSS effects)
- [ ] Simple search/filter functionality
- [ ] Makefile targets for Hugo build and serve
- [ ] Both Go API (port 3002) and Hugo site (port 1313) running

## Technical Requirements
- Hugo latest stable version
- No themes or minimal default theme
- Plain HTML layouts
- Basic markdown content
- Simple data fetching from existing Go API endpoints
- No JavaScript animations or effects
- No CSS styling beyond browser defaults

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Hugo site builds successfully
