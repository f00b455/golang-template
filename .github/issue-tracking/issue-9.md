## Description
## Bug Description
The RSS filtering feature from issue #5 is missing the user interface components in the web application.

## Current Behavior
- Web interface at http://localhost:8081 displays RSS headlines
- No filter textfield is present
- Users cannot filter headlines by keywords

## Expected Behavior
According to issue #5 requirements:
- Filter input field should be present above the RSS feed list
- Placeholder text: "Filter headlines... (e.g., Politik, Wirtschaft)"
- Real-time or button-triggered filtering
- Clear filter button or 'x' in input field
- Show count of filtered results (e.g., "Showing 5 of 12 matching articles")

## Missing Components
- [ ] Filter input field in templates/index.html
- [ ] JavaScript filtering logic
- [ ] Connection to API endpoint with filter parameter
- [ ] UI feedback for filtered results count

## Technical Notes
- API endpoint /api/rss/spiegel/top5 already supports ?filter parameter
- Need to update refreshHeadlines() function to include filter
- Should follow BDD-first approach with feature files

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Filter textfield visible on web interface
- [ ] Real-time filtering working
- [ ] Clear filter functionality
- [ ] Results count display
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
