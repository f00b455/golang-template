## Description
## Test Issue for CI/CD Validation

This is a small test issue to verify that the CI/CD pipeline is working correctly after recent fixes.

### Test Objectives:
- Verify pipeline orchestrator workflow runs without errors
- Confirm Hugo is properly installed in CI environment
- Validate all pipeline labels are created and functional
- Test that BDD tests pass with Hugo integration

### Expected Behavior:
1. Auto-branch PR workflow should create a branch and PR
2. Pipeline orchestrator should manage the workflow states
3. Tests should pass with Hugo installed
4. All pipeline labels should work correctly

### Test Steps:
1. This issue triggers the auto-branch-pr workflow
2. A PR will be created automatically
3. The pipeline orchestrator will manage the CI process
4. We can observe if all fixes are working
