## Description
## Description
Add test coverage validation to the CI/CD pipeline to ensure production code maintains a minimum of 95% test coverage.

## Requirements
- [ ] Add coverage calculation for production code (excluding test files)
- [ ] Set minimum coverage threshold at 95%
- [ ] Fail CI pipeline if coverage is below threshold
- [ ] Generate coverage reports for visibility
- [ ] Exclude test files, mocks, and generated code from coverage calculation
- [ ] Display coverage percentage in PR checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- CI pipeline calculates test coverage for all production code
- Pipeline fails if coverage drops below 95%
- Coverage reports are available in PR comments or artifacts
- Clear error messages when coverage threshold is not met

## Technical Approach
1. Update Go test commands to generate detailed coverage profiles
2. Use go tool cover to calculate coverage percentages
3. Add coverage gate check in GitHub Actions workflow
4. Integrate with Codecov or similar service for reporting
5. Configure exclusions for non-production code

## Benefits
- Ensures high code quality and maintainability
- Prevents untested code from reaching production
- Provides visibility into testing gaps
- Encourages developers to write comprehensive tests
