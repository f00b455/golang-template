            ðŸ”§ Code Improvement Iteration ${{ steps.get-improvement.outputs.ITERATION }}/3 - Implementing review suggestions

            This PR has passing tests but code review identified improvements needed. Please implement the suggested improvements from the code review.

            1. **Review the Claude code review comments** to understand what improvements are needed:
               - Use `gh pr view ${{ steps.check-improvements.outputs.PR_NUMBER }} --json comments` to see all comments
               - Focus on comments from Claude that contain specific improvement suggestions
               - Pay attention to sections like "Issues & Recommendations" and "Required Actions Before Merge"

            2. **Implement the improvements** in priority order:
               - Security issues (missing headers, validation, etc.)
               - Performance improvements (buffering, caching, etc.)
               - Error handling improvements
               - Code quality improvements (refactoring, documentation)

            3. **Validate your changes** after each improvement:
               - Run `make lint && make test && make build` to ensure nothing breaks
               - Only commit if all checks still pass

            4. **Commit improvements** with clear messages:
               ```
               git add [files]
               git commit -m "improve: [specific improvement] based on review feedback"
               git push
               ```

            5. **Report your improvements** with a PR comment including:
               - What improvements were implemented
               - What suggestions were deferred and why
               - Current code quality status

            **Important constraints:**
            - Only implement improvements that maintain backward compatibility
            - Don't change the API interface unless specifically requested
            - Preserve all existing tests
            - Focus on the highest-impact improvements first
            - If an improvement is too risky or complex, document it for manual review

            Use `gh pr comment ${{ steps.check-improvements.outputs.PR_NUMBER }}` to report your progress.

          ðŸ”§ **Code Improvement Max Iterations Reached**

          After 3 improvement iterations, further enhancements should be reviewed manually.

          The code should now be in good shape with critical issues addressed.
          Please review the changes and decide if any remaining suggestions need manual implementation.
